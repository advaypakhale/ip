## Week 2

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet

- **Used for**
    - Generating a simple `AI.md` file for the project.
    - Generating sample test cases for the project.
- **Effectiveness**
    - The tool was effective in generating the initial structure of the `AI.md` file.
    - The tool was effective in generating sample test cases for the project.
- **Time Impact**
    - The tool saved time in generating the initial structure of the `AI.md` file.
    - The tool saved time in generating sample test cases for the project.
- **Challenges**
    - The tool was not able to generate all the test cases required for the project. Some human oversight was still
      required.

### GitHub Copilot

- **Used for**
    - Auto-completing code snippets throughout the project, although generally _minimally_ method signatures were still
      manually written.
- **Effectiveness**
    - The tool was effective in auto-completing basic logic and boilerplate, such as the error messages for exceptions.
- **Time Impact**
    - The tool saved time in writing boilerplate code.
- **Challenges**
    - The tool often suggested code that was not relevant to the current context, which required manual filtering.
    - The tool often generated code that did not align with the architecture of the project I had in mind.
